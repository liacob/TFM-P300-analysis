# TFM-P300-analysis

In this repository I will post my journey along my Masters Degree final project (TFM). In which I will analyze the P300 signal in EEG obtained in the Hoffman experiment:
**An efficient P300-based brainâ€“computer interface for disabled subjects** which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027007001094?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint" target="_blank">here</a>.

The repo will contain the data obtained by Hoffman and a self explanatory playbook I developed for the journey.

Hope you enjoy it :)
