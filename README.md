# TFM-P300-analysis

In this repository I will post my journey along my Masters Degree final project (TFM). 

In which I will analyze the P300 signal in EEG obtained in the Hoffman experiment:

Ulrich Hoffmann, Jean-Marc Vesin, Touradj Ebrahimi, and Karin Diserens. **An efficient P300-based brain–computer interface for disabled subjects.** Journal of Neuroscience
Methods, 167(1):115–125, 2008. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). It can be downloaded <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027007001094?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint" target="_blank">here</a>.

The repo will contain the data obtained by Hoffman, a self explanatory playbook I developed for the journey and some Matlab scripts where we use the BLDA classifier proposed by Hoffmann.

Hope you enjoy it :)
